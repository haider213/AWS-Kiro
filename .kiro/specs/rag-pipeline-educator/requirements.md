# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RAG Pipeline Educator is an interactive web application designed to teach Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concepts through hands-on simulations and visualizations. The system enables users to experiment with different RAG pipeline components, adjust parameters in real-time, and observe the immediate effects on text processing and retrieval outcomes. This educational tool targets both technical and non-technical audiences at hackathons and educational events.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to understand chunking strategies through interactive experimentation, so that I can make informed decisions about text segmentation in my RAG implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a chunking strategy, THE Chunking_Module SHALL display the selected algorithm's parameters as adjustable controls
2. WHEN a user modifies chunking parameters, THE Chunking_Module SHALL immediately re-process the Sample_Text and update the visual representation
3. THE Chunking_Module SHALL support fixed-size, semantic, sentence-based, and paragraph-based chunking strategies
4. WHEN chunking is applied, THE Visualization_Engine SHALL highlight chunk boundaries with distinct colors and display chunk metadata
5. THE Chunking_Module SHALL display performance metrics including chunk count, average chunk size, and overlap statistics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to demonstrate embedding concepts visually, so that students can grasp vector similarity and semantic relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text chunks are processed, THE Embedding_Module SHALL generate and display vector representations in a 2D or 3D space
2. WHEN a user hovers over a chunk visualization, THE Embedding_Module SHALL highlight similar chunks based on vector proximity
3. THE Embedding_Module SHALL provide controls for adjusting similarity thresholds and display the resulting cluster formations
4. WHEN similarity calculations occur, THE Visualization_Engine SHALL render connection lines between related chunks with opacity indicating similarity strength
5. THE Embedding_Module SHALL support comparison between different embedding models with side-by-side visualizations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning RAG, I want to experiment with retrieval mechanisms, so that I can understand how queries match against document chunks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a query, THE Retrieval_Module SHALL perform real-time search against processed chunks and rank results by relevance
2. THE Retrieval_Module SHALL support both keyword-based and semantic search modes with toggle controls
3. WHEN search results are generated, THE Visualization_Engine SHALL highlight matching chunks and display relevance scores
4. THE Retrieval_Module SHALL provide adjustable parameters for result count limits and similarity thresholds
5. WHEN hybrid retrieval is selected, THE Retrieval_Module SHALL combine keyword and semantic results with weighted scoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workshop attendee, I want to see how retrieved context affects generation quality, so that I can understand the complete RAG pipeline flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieval results are available, THE Generation_Module SHALL simulate response generation using the retrieved context
2. THE Generation_Module SHALL display the constructed prompt including retrieved chunks and user query
3. WHEN context window limits are reached, THE Generation_Module SHALL demonstrate truncation strategies and their effects
4. THE Generation_Module SHALL provide controls for adjusting context selection criteria and generation parameters
5. THE Generation_Module SHALL display multiple response variations to demonstrate the impact of different context combinations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cohesive learning experience across all RAG components, so that I can understand how the entire pipeline works together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RAG_System SHALL maintain consistent Sample_Text across all modules to demonstrate end-to-end processing
2. WHEN a user modifies parameters in one module, THE RAG_System SHALL propagate relevant changes to downstream modules
3. THE RAG_System SHALL provide a guided tour mode that walks users through each pipeline stage sequentially
4. THE RAG_System SHALL include educational explanations and tooltips for each concept and parameter
5. THE RAG_System SHALL support saving and sharing parameter configurations for collaborative learning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a hackathon organizer, I want the application to be accessible and performant, so that all participants can use it effectively during the event.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RAG_System SHALL load and become interactive within 3 seconds on standard web browsers
2. THE RAG_System SHALL support concurrent usage by multiple users without performance degradation
3. THE RAG_System SHALL be responsive and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
4. THE RAG_System SHALL provide keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for accessibility
5. THE RAG_System SHALL function offline after initial load for reliable hackathon usage
